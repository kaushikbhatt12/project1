# MELODY

This code is made using tkinter which is standard GUI(graphic user interface) package of python. One needs to install python youtube module pytube for using it. Pytube can be installed 
using the command "pip install pytube".

One can search his favourite song/album/artist and then download the song using this GUI. It also allows the flexibility to download in three formats which are low video quality, high
video quality and audio only format. It also lets the user choose the path where he/she wants to save the file on his/her system.

This code uses youtube to search and download the song typed by the user and it provides various options to choose from while downloading a song which may include various versions of the same song or songs with same names. By doing some minor changes in the code this code can also be used to download any video from youtube.
